# $Header$
#
# You have following:
# - Linux
# - tinolib in the subdirectory tino/
# - A source with a main() called xxxNAMExxx.c
#
# Following will be extended and might change slightly.
# However I want it to stay this simple, or even more simple!
#
# Now create a stub Makefile.tino like this:
# --------8<--------8<--------8<--------
#       PROG=xxxNAMExxx
#      PROGS=$(PROG)
#       OBJS=
#    LDFLAGS=
#     LDLIBS=
#      CLEAN=
#  DISTCLEAN=
# # TINOCOPY=
# #   TINOINC=tino_common.h
# #   TINOLIB=tino/lib.h
# ##END##
# Makefile::
#	$(MAKE) -C tino tino HERE="$(PWD)"
# -------->8-------->8-------->8--------
# Then do:
#	make -f Makefile.tino
# this will create the initial Makefile.
# From now on the Makefile will update itself.
#
# Note that the basic functions of the Makefile then can live
# without the sub directory tino/
# Some errors will show up, but everything still compiles.
#
# What's the dark matter with all this here?
#
# I want a hassle free method of keeping everything updated for me.
# I want "make" to make it all, so no "./configure; make"
# I want to be able to build everything without GNU extensions.
#
# The latter does not mean to not use GNU extensions at all.
# However it shall be easy to comment them out and still have a
# successful build.
#
# Additionally a minimum of standard unix utilities shall be needed
# to run this all.  Note that I already think it needs too many of them.
# However "make all" shall still do, I hope.
#
# Prerequisites for "make all" in a distribution shall be:
# 1) make
# 2) gawk
# Nothing else (not even a bash, perl etc.) shall be needed,
# and not a compiler with support for -M or -MM.
#
# To use all features, you probably need a huge Linux environment and
# some undefined and unclear setups (like CVS) in place.  However it's
# the idea for the distribution to have an easy "make all" process.
# And that the distribution can be independent of tinolib if the sources
# do not depend on this library.
#
# That's why it is as it is.

# Revision 1.8  2004-08-22 05:47:34  Administrator
# Now Makefile generator understands to look into variables set in Makefile.
# This way Auto-Dependicies can be improved a little step and more important,
# the "TINOCOPY" functionality was added, such that I can copy files from
# elsewhere to the distribution and keep that files in sync.
