	* buf.h (tino_buf_read, tino_buf_write): now return int as they
	should

	* sock.h (tino_sock_free): filedescriptor is always destroyed
	after process(.., TINO_SOCK_CLOSE), stupid to leave this to the
	routine sometimes.

	* sock.h (tino_sock_new): Well, one little star makes a big
	difference.  A serious memory corruption occured because there was
	too few memory allocated.  Thanks to -lefence
