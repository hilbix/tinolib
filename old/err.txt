This is the list of known error prefixes (see err.h), it is the BBB
part of the error tags of the form ABBBnnnC.  BBB means, it shall be 3
letters or longer.  Reservations must be 2 letters long at minimum,
longer are preferred.  You can add as many letters to your reservation
as you like (so if you have ZZ you can use prefixes ZZA to ZZZ as you
like, too).  If global bigger projects (like Perl or PHP) want to
reserve a single letter to allocate their own prefixes, I will support
this.  Some recommendations are already present (not that I think that
anybody ever in this universe will request such a prefix from me).

Pre-Allocations are from me for all the standard Internet
organizations.
