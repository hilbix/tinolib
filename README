IMPORTANT!  READ THE DISCLAIMER AT THE END!

This is a funny library, as it's thought to be included, not linked.

This way you have a broad possibility to change how the library works.

It's a quick_n_dirty library to make writing new little tools as easy
as possible.  The most routines have a default error handling of
terminating the current process and write to stdout (see function
ex()).

You will need this library for 99% of all of my future software
releases.

That's all about you have to know.


How to install:
===============

1) Unpack tinolib into a directory, i. e. TINOLIB

2) Use it as it comes pre-installed with prefix tino_

Variant 1: add TINOLIB/tino_inc/ to the include path
Variant 2: softlink TINOLIB/tino_dir/ to tino/


USUALLY YOU DON'T NEED TO DO FOLLOWING:

3) You can 're-compile' it with a changed prefix:

In TINOLIB type "bin/gen prefix".

"prefix_" then replaces the prefix "tino_" in the library.

You can either use variant 1 or 2 with the new prefix.
Remember that tino_ in the directory names is replaced by
the new prefix!


4) If you have tinolib in CVS, you just can extract the
include directory you want.  It's easy, it's complete.


How to use:
===========

"function" is the part (the filename in src/ without .c) you want to
use, all lower letters.  To just include only one function, you can do
#define tino_FN_function

There is an experimental tino_ALL for just include of everything.
And there are some "convenience defines" like "tino_ALL_MEM" etc.

Everything else is open for future use.


Variant 1a: Use the include directly (default, tested but deprecated)

#include "tino_function.h"

Variant 1b: Use functions without prefix (untested)

#define tino_function
#define	tino_QUICK_N_DIRTY
#include "tinolib.h"

Variant 1c: Use functions with prefix (untested)

#define tino_function
#define	tino_QUICK
#include "tinolib.h"


Variant 2a: Use the include directly (default, tested but deprecated)
(Use function with prefix)

#include "tino/_function.h"

Variant 2b: Use functions without prefix (untested)
(This also works if tino/ can be found via include path)

#define tino_function
#define	tino_QUICK_N_DIRTY
#include "tino/lib.h"

Variant 2c: Use functions with prefix (untested)
(This also works if tino/ can be found via include path)

#define tino_function
#define	tino_QUICK
#include "tino/lib.h"



How to learn:
=============

This part will show up in the doc/ folder sometimes.


How to make:
============

Usually tinolib will come completely precompiled (as it's only for
include purpose, you don't have to worry about binary distribution).

If you want to remake it, you need some further utilities like awk
etc. to build.  Just type "make", this will create the tino_*
directories.

NEVER EDIT IN THESE DIRECTORIES, AS THE CONTENTS IS OVERWRITTEN!

To permanently change the prefix, edit the Makefile.


How to alter or extend:
=======================

If you find errors/bugs/etc. please corret them and send them to me.

Besides of this you are not supposed to alter/extend tinolib.  It's my
library.  OK?

But if you do, then please send all changes and additions to me, such
that I can support these changes.  I will incorporate this into the
library if it fits in.

However I will take over the copyright on all changes you send me.
You have to abide your copyright, or else I cannot incorporate it for
now, until the contrib part is ready.  Always you have to abide the
copyright for the interface part of your work, as I might decide to go
to LGPL, and in this case, the interface part must become Public Domain.

With contrib you can keep your copyright.  However it may be that
there comes up a complete rewrite of something in contrib, such that
the copyright goes to me.


How to distribute:
==================

tinolib is Copyright (C)2004 by Valentin Hilbig

This is free software according to the GNU General Public License
(GPL) version 2 or higher.  See the file COPYING.

However, on the first distribution, see the disclaimer below.


Disclaimer:
===========

Me refers to Valentin Hilbig.  Google me, you will find me.

You can rely on the fact, that I do my best to write safe and secure
software.  However shit happens, and to make sure no lawyers out there
try to sue me or even worse, try to confiscate my computers (which for
me is of far more trouble than that I am personally held in prison
while beeing innocent) I have to make clear some things:

Note that this is no restriction to the GPL.  You are still allowed to
distribute according to the GPL.  These terms and conditions only
restrict the initial (first) distribution from me, which is fully in
sync with GNU - I have the copyright, so I can distribute as I like.
So after this first distribution, everybody is allowed to distribute
according to the GPL.  However I cannot be held liable for such
secondary distributions.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS TERMS, YOU MUST NOT USE TINOLIB AND ANY
DERIVED WORKS OR SOFTWARE WHICH USES THIS LIBRARY.

You agree that you use my software AS IS and fully at your own risk.
Nobody except yourself can be hold liable in case the software
misbehaves or there are errors within.  If you distribute the
software, you agree to held me free from any threats which may arise
out of the distribution to others, too.

In case the software contains malicious code which has been placed
there by purpose, you agree, that you have to bring full, trustworthy
and complete evidence who is guilty for this without help of me,
except of the help I give you voluntarily.  So you cannot sue me to
hand out any data bejond the point, where my free will ends.

If you find malicious code, please immediately inform me, such that I
can stop further downloads of the infected software.

NOTE THAT I DO NOT RESTRICT ANYTHING ELSE.  I WANT YOU TO MAKE SUCH
THINGS PUBLIC.  AS TO ERR IS HUMAN I WILL NEVER CHARGE YOU IF YOU
HONESTLY DID A FALSE ALARM BY MISTAKE!

SO ALWAYS ON SECURITY THINGS, FIRST ALARM OTHERS, THEN ACT FURTHER!
