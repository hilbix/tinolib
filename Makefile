# $Header$
#
# This is the central Makefile of the "old" version of tinolib.
# (old means: tinolib does not yet have the structure I want it to have.)
#
# This Makefile mainly is a bunch of a lot of helpers.
# See README for information on how to use it.
#
# The usual targets:
# all	clean	distclean
# test (but see below)
#
# The magic targets (resembled in Makefile.proto too):
# tar	create an intermediate archive based on VERSION file.
#	This does not check CVS.  Use this instead of "dist"!
# tino	Create Makefile from Makefile.tino using Makefile.proto
#	This probably is no very clever name, however I cannot
#	call it "Makefile" as this is reserved for make internally.
#
# The magic targets which probably only help me:
# dist	create a new distribution archive based on VERSION file.
#	This makes sure everything is checked into CVS and
#	then does a CVS distribution tag.  Includes "distclean".
#	More magic may go into this in future, too.
# diff	Show what differs to CVS HEAD revision.
#	This greatly helps me to keep track of all those distrubuted
#	changes in my libs and programs etc.
#
# Test targets:
# check	MISSING TODAY (sadly)
#	Create a clean checked version (-lefence etc.)
#	This shall go before make test
# test	INCOMPLETE TODAY
#	Make check and run all unit tests.
#	This shall always go before make dist.
