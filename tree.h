/* Generic Data Tree
 *
 * See iter.h for more information
 *
 * This is a gerneric data tree implementation in that the
 * representation is hidden from the caller.
 *
 * Currently there only is "ctree", which means, a character based
 * tree.  This is for storing unique strings (or data) associated with
 * some pointer.  Note that the tree itself does not store the given
 * string (or whatever) in a usable form.
